# Technologies

1. Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This website is completely static
   and I use basic HTML or Markdown for everything.
1. Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I'm using the
   [GitHub Pages Gem](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
   and only Jekyll plugins that are
   [available on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-metadata-on-github-pages/).
1. The design is loosely based on [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper),
   [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com/), and [Medium](https://medium.com/).
1. I used [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/),
   [Font Awesome Icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/),
   [Hint.css](http://kushagragour.in/lab/hint/),and
   [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) for styling.
1. I used [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [lazySizes](http://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/),
   and [responsive-nav.js](http://responsive-nav.com/) for behavior.
1. I added [Disqus](https://disqus.com/websites/) as a commenting system.
1. I'm using [UptimeRobot](http://uptimerobot.com/) and
   [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) for monitoring and
